# Data Science portflio by Alai Yosief

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis using a variety of statistical methods. A separate category is for separate projects. Kaggle was used as the soure of the data sets and ideas.

## Regression problems.

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

[Github](https://github.com/AlaiY95/Alai.Github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/AlaiY95/Alai.Github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb)

House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on information about houses we predict their prices. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.

## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](https://github.com/AlaiY95/Alai.Github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/AlaiY95/Alai.Github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for applying statistical knowledge.

Add other projects i've completed and give a description - AY
